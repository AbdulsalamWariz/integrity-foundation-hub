## About Us

The Olorunyomi Babatunde Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting academic honesty and ethical leadership among adolescents and young people. We design and implement school outreach campaigns, community sensitisation programmes, and youth empowerment initiatives that reduce exam malpractice and open alternative, honourable pathways to success. OBF works with educators, parents, community and religious leaders to create lasting, systemic change in the culture of learning across communities.

### Why We Exist

Academic integrity is the bedrock of meaningful learning and social trust. When young people are supported to succeed through skill, perseverance and integrity, communities benefit from stronger leaders, entrepreneurs and citizens. OBF exists to shift mindsets, strengthen institutions, and support young people to thrive honestly.

## Our Goal
